Novatel MiFi 2200 Status Panel
------------------------------

Only tested on Gnome + ubuntu
Please email if you have issues

xantus a.t xantus d.o.t org

Installing
----------
You need perl modules:
EV, Gtk2, Gtk2::TrayIcon

And an activated MiFi of course.

Optional: Install the libnotify-bin package for notificaitons

Important!
----------
The default ip for the MiFi is 192.168.1.1, if yours isn't
then edit $ip in mini-status.pl

Running
-------
For now, just manuall start it in a terminal
./mifi-status.pl

On first run, the icons for the status bar will be
downloaded from your MiFi and placed into images/
relative to the binary


I'll come up with some sort of wifi connection trigger later!
