Novatel MiFi 2200 Status Panel
------------------------------

This only works for Wifi mode, not modem mode.

Any computer connected to your MiFi can use this
status panel tool, no web admin authentication
is needed.

If you need to charge your MiFi and keep it in
Wifi mode, then visit:

This has only been tested on Gnome + ubuntu
Please email me if you have issues!

Installing
----------
You need perl modules:
AnyEvent::HTTP, EV, Gtk2::TrayIcon, Gtk2

And an activated MiFi of course.

Optional: Install the libnotify-bin package for notificaitons

wget is also needed to download the resource images

Important!
----------
The default ip for the MiFi is 192.168.1.1, if yours isn't
then edit $ip in mini-status.pl

Running
-------
For now, just manuall start it in a terminal
./mifi-status.pl

On first run, the icons for the status bar will be
downloaded from your MiFi and placed into images/
relative to the binary


I will come up with some sort of wifi connection trigger later!
